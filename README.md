# budgetTracker
## About This Project
This is an application I built to help me better keep track of my own finances. I had often struggled with the limitations of apps like Mint, and had grown tired of using my own spreadsheets to keep track of my budget. So I built an app that lets me input my expenses & income and displays monthly and yearly totals so I know exactly what I'm spending.

## Built With
I used Django to build the whole app, along with Postgres for the database, and deployed with heroku.
