# budgetTracker
In this project, I used Django to build an application that will help me better keep track of my own finances. I had often struggled with the limitations of apps like Mint, and had grown tired of using my own spreadsheets to keep track of my budget. So I built an app that lets me input my expenses & income and displays monthly and yearly totals so I know exactly what I'm spending. In the future, I hope to add goal setting functionality and reconfigure the app to use ReactJs with the Django REST Framework.

I used Postgres for the database and deployed to heroku. Styling done with HTML, CSS, Js, and Bootstrap.
